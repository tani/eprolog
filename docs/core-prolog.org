* Core Prolog Functionality

Prolog operates on a beautifully simple yet powerful principle: you describe what you know (facts) and what can be inferred (rules), then ask questions about this knowledge. This section explores the fundamental architecture of logical programming, showing how ε-prolog transforms declarative statements into a queryable knowledge base.

Understanding these core concepts is essential because they form the conceptual foundation for everything else in Prolog. Unlike imperative programming where you tell the computer *how* to solve problems, Prolog lets you describe *what* the problem is and lets the system figure out the solution through logical inference.

** Facts and Rules

Think of facts as the basic building blocks of knowledge—simple, indisputable statements about your domain. Rules, on the other hand, are logical recipes that show how to derive new knowledge from existing facts and other rules. Together, they form a powerful knowledge representation system that can answer complex questions through logical inference.

The beauty of this approach lies in its declarative nature: you don't need to specify *how* to find answers, only *what* relationships exist. The Prolog engine handles the reasoning process, exploring different logical paths to find solutions.

In ε-prolog, both facts and rules are defined using ~eprolog-define-predicate~. This unified interface makes it easy to build sophisticated knowledge bases incrementally.

Key concepts demonstrated in this subsection:
- *Fact Definition*: Establishing basic truths (like family relationships)
- *Rule Creation*: Defining logical implications (deriving grandparent from parent relationships)
- *Knowledge Base Querying*: Asking questions and getting answers
- *Solution Collection*: Gathering all possible answers to a query

This test demonstrates the fundamental pattern of Prolog programming: starting with basic facts and building complex relationships through rules. We create a family tree and then derive grandparent relationships from parent facts:

** Unification and Equality

Unification is the pattern matching engine at the heart of Prolog. When Prolog tries to match a goal against facts or rules, it uses unification to determine if terms can be made identical by finding appropriate variable bindings. This process is fundamental to how Prolog explores the solution space and propagates constraints through your logic programs.

The equals predicate (=) performs unification between two terms. If the terms can be unified (made identical through variable bindings), the predicate succeeds; otherwise, it fails. This isn't the same as testing for existing equality—it actively creates bindings to make the terms equal if possible.

Key unification concepts:
- *Variable Binding*: Unbound variables can be unified with any term
- *Structural Matching*: Complex terms unify if their structure and components match
- *Bidirectional Nature*: Unification works symmetrically (X=Y is the same as Y=X)
- *Occurs Check*: Prevents creating infinite structures (optional in ε-prolog)

Understanding the difference between unification (=) and strict equality (==) is crucial for effective Prolog programming. While unification creates bindings, strict equality only tests existing values without creating new bindings.
