* Core Prolog Functionality

Prolog operates on a beautifully simple yet powerful principle: you describe what you know (facts) and what can be inferred (rules), then ask questions about this knowledge. This section explores the fundamental architecture of logical programming, showing how ε-prolog transforms declarative statements into a queryable knowledge base.

Understanding these core concepts is essential because they form the conceptual foundation for everything else in Prolog. Unlike imperative programming where you tell the computer *how* to solve problems, Prolog lets you describe *what* the problem is and lets the system figure out the solution through logical inference.

** Facts and Rules

This section introduces the fundamental building blocks of logical programming: facts and rules. These constitute the knowledge representation layer that transforms ε-prolog from a programming language into a reasoning system capable of drawing logical conclusions from stated premises.

Facts represent unconditional truths—basic assertions about your problem domain that require no proof or justification. They serve as the axioms of your logical system. Rules, in contrast, represent conditional knowledge—logical implications that derive new conclusions from existing information. Together, facts and rules create a deductive system where complex questions can be answered through logical inference.

The power of this approach lies in its declarative nature: instead of writing algorithms that specify how to compute answers, you describe the logical relationships that exist in your domain. The Prolog engine becomes your reasoning partner, automatically exploring the logical consequences of your statements to find solutions.

Core concepts in this section:
- **Fact Definition**: Establishing unconditional truths as the foundation of your knowledge base
- **Rule Creation**: Defining conditional relationships that derive new knowledge from existing facts
- **Knowledge Base Querying**: Formulating questions and retrieving answers through logical inference
- **Solution Enumeration**: Systematically discovering all possible answers to logical queries
- **Deductive Reasoning**: How the engine combines facts and rules to reach conclusions

This test demonstrates the fundamental pattern of Prolog programming: starting with basic facts and building complex relationships through rules. We create a family tree and then derive grandparent relationships from parent facts:

** Unification and Equality

This section explores unification, the sophisticated pattern matching mechanism that serves as the computational engine of Prolog. Unification goes beyond simple equality checking—it's a bidirectional constraint satisfaction process that determines whether terms can be made identical through variable instantiation.

Unification is what makes Prolog queries so powerful: when you ask a question, the system doesn't just check for exact matches. Instead, it intelligently explores how variables could be bound to make your query true. This process enables Prolog to work backwards from goals to find the inputs that would make those goals succeed, effectively turning your logic programs into constraint solvers.

Understanding unification mechanics is crucial because it affects every aspect of Prolog execution: how goals match against clauses, how variables propagate their bindings across subgoals, and how the system explores alternative solution paths.

Key unification concepts covered:
- **Term Matching**: How structured terms unify through recursive pattern matching
- **Variable Binding**: The process of instantiating variables to make terms identical
- **Bidirectional Constraint Propagation**: How bindings flow through complex term structures
- **Occurs Check**: Preventing infinite structures in unification
- **Unification vs. Equality**: The distinction between pattern matching and value comparison

The equals predicate (=) performs unification between two terms. If the terms can be unified (made identical through variable bindings), the predicate succeeds; otherwise, it fails. This isn't the same as testing for existing equality—it actively creates bindings to make the terms equal if possible.

Key unification concepts:
- *Variable Binding*: Unbound variables can be unified with any term
- *Structural Matching*: Complex terms unify if their structure and components match
- *Bidirectional Nature*: Unification works symmetrically (X=Y is the same as Y=X)
- *Occurs Check*: Prevents creating infinite structures (optional in ε-prolog)

Understanding the difference between unification (=) and strict equality (==) is crucial for effective Prolog programming. While unification creates bindings, strict equality only tests existing values without creating new bindings.

** Resource Exhaustion and Performance Tests

This section rigorously tests ε-prolog's behavior under extreme conditions, including resource exhaustion, performance boundaries, and stress scenarios. These tests ensure that the system degrades gracefully under pressure rather than failing catastrophically.

Understanding how a Prolog system behaves under stress is crucial for building reliable applications. These tests verify that ε-prolog maintains logical consistency and provides predictable failure modes when faced with resource constraints or computationally intensive queries.

*** Memory Stress Tests

These tests stress the memory management systems by creating many facts, complex variable binding chains, and large knowledge bases to verify stable operation under memory pressure.

** Edge Cases and Special Character Handling

This section explores the robustness of ε-prolog's term handling across diverse character sets, boundary conditions, and edge cases that test the limits of the parser and unification system.

Comprehensive edge case testing ensures that ε-prolog handles unusual but valid inputs gracefully, maintaining consistency across different character encodings, atom naming conventions, and boundary values that might cause issues in less robust systems.

*** Special Character and Unicode Tests

These tests verify that ε-prolog correctly handles atoms with special characters, Unicode symbols, and non-standard naming conventions, ensuring robust internationalization support.
