* Complex Examples and Applications

This section explores sophisticated applications of ε-prolog, demonstrating how fundamental concepts combine to solve real-world problems. These examples showcase Prolog's unique strengths in relational reasoning, recursive problem solving, and elegant expression of complex logical relationships.

** Family Tree Relationships

Few domains illustrate Prolog's expressive power as clearly as family relationships. What begins as a simple collection of parent-child facts blossoms into a rich knowledge base capable of answering complex genealogical questions. This classic application demonstrates how Prolog's declarative approach naturally mirrors human reasoning about kinship.

The elegance of family tree modeling in Prolog lies in how closely the logical representation matches our intuitive understanding of relationships. When we define that "X is a grandparent of Z if X is a parent of Y and Y is a parent of Z," we're expressing exactly the kind of logical reasoning humans use naturally. Prolog simply makes this reasoning computational.

*** Comprehensive Family Tree Tests

Building a family tree in Prolog involves layering increasingly complex relationships on top of basic facts. This approach mirrors how we think about family relationships in the real world.

Family trees provide an excellent example of how basic facts can be combined with rules to derive complex relationships. We start with basic parent relationships and build up to sophisticated kinship queries.

This subsection covers:
- Basic parent and marriage relationships
- Gender distinctions for more precise relationship modeling
- How facts and rules work together to build knowledge bases
- The foundation for more complex relationship derivations

The following test establishes a comprehensive family tree covering all relationship types and complex queries:

** Complex Backtracking and Control Flow

Understanding backtracking is essential for mastering Prolog. This section explores advanced scenarios where careful control of backtracking behavior is crucial for correct and efficient programs.

*** Complex Backtracking Scenarios

The cut operator provides fine-grained control over Prolog's backtracking mechanism:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-complex-backtracking-with-cut ()
  "Test complex backtracking scenarios with cut."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)
  
  ;; Define choice predicates
  (eprolog-define-prolog-predicate! (color red))
  (eprolog-define-prolog-predicate (color green))
  (eprolog-define-prolog-predicate (color blue))
  
  ;; Define predicate that uses cut
  (eprolog-define-prolog-predicate! (first-color _x)
    (color _x) !)
  
  ;; Test without cut - should get all solutions
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((color _x)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 3)))
  
  ;; Test with cut - should get only first solution
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((first-color _x)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 1))
    (should (equal (cdr (assoc '_x (car solutions))) 'red))))
#+end_SRC

The repeat predicate combined with cut creates controlled loops:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-repeat-with-complex-conditions ()
  "Test repeat predicate with complex termination conditions."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)
  
  ;; Test repeat with counter and cut
  (let ((counter 0))
    (eprolog-define-predicate (test-repeat-complex)
      (repeat)
      (lisp! (setq counter (1+ counter)))
      (lispp (>= counter 5))
      !)
    
    (should (eprolog-test--has-solution-p '((test-repeat-complex))))
    (should (= counter 5))))
#+end_SRC

** Advanced Applications

The true test of any programming paradigm lies in its ability to express complex algorithms elegantly and naturally. This section ventures beyond basic Prolog concepts to explore how classical computational problems can be reimagined through the lens of logical relationships. These examples demonstrate that Prolog isn't just suitable for AI and symbolic reasoning—it's a versatile tool for algorithmic thinking.

*** Recursive Algorithms

Factorial calculation demonstrates basic recursion in Prolog:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-factorial ()
  "Test recursive factorial implementation."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)
  
  ;; Define factorial predicate
  (eprolog-define-predicate! (factorial 0 1))
  (eprolog-define-predicate (factorial _n _f)
    (lispp (> _n 0))
    (is _n1 (- _n 1))
    (factorial _n1 _f1)
    (is _f (* _n _f1)))
  
  ;; Test factorial calculations
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((factorial 0 _f)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 1))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_f (car solutions))) 1)))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((factorial 3 _f)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 1))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_f (car solutions))) 6)))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((factorial 5 _f)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 1))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_f (car solutions))) 120))))
#+end_SRC

The Fibonacci sequence shows more complex recursive patterns:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-fibonacci ()
  "Test Fibonacci sequence implementation."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)
  
  ;; Define Fibonacci predicate
  (eprolog-define-predicate! (fib 0 0))
  (eprolog-define-predicate (fib 1 1))
  (eprolog-define-predicate (fib _n _f)
    (lispp (> _n 1))
    (is _n1 (- _n 1))
    (is _n2 (- _n 2))
    (fib _n1 _f1)
    (fib _n2 _f2)
    (is _f (+ _f1 _f2)))
 
  ;; Test Fibonacci calculations
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((fib 0 _f)))))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_f (car solutions))) 0)))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((fib 1 _f)))))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_f (car solutions))) 1)))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((fib 3 _f)))))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_f (car solutions))) 2)))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((fib 4 _f)))))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_f (car solutions))) 3))))
#+end_SRC

The Greatest Common Divisor algorithm demonstrates iterative computation in Prolog:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-gcd-algorithm ()
  "Test Greatest Common Divisor algorithm."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)
  
  ;; Define GCD predicate
  (eprolog-define-predicate! (gcd _a 0 _a))
  (eprolog-define-predicate (gcd _a _b _g)
    (lispp (> _b 0))
    (is _r (mod _a _b))
    (gcd _b _r _g))
  
  ;; Test GCD calculations
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((gcd 48 18 _g)))))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_g (car solutions))) 6)))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((gcd 15 25 _g)))))
    (should (= (cdr (assoc '_g (car solutions))) 5))))
#+end_SRC

** Performance Testing

No programming system is complete without understanding its performance characteristics and limitations. While Prolog's declarative nature provides tremendous expressive power, it's essential to understand how that power scales with problem size and complexity. This section explores ε-prolog's performance envelope through systematic testing.

Performance testing in logic programming differs from traditional benchmarking because the focus isn't just on raw execution speed—it's on understanding how logical inference scales with database size, recursion depth, and problem complexity. These tests help establish confidence that ε-prolog can handle real-world applications effectively.

Key performance dimensions evaluated:
- *Database Scaling*: How performance varies with the number of facts and rules
- *Recursion Depth*: The system's ability to handle deep logical reasoning chains  
- *Memory Management*: Behavior under high predicate density and complex structures
- *Inference Complexity*: Performance with multiple choice points and backtracking scenarios

Comprehensive performance testing evaluates multiple aspects of system performance:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-performance-tests ()
  "Test performance with larger databases and deep recursion."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)

  ;; Test large database performance
  (dotimes (i 100)
    (eval `(eprolog-define-predicate (test-num ,i))))

  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((test-num _x)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 100)))

  ;; Test deep recursion
  (eprolog-define-predicate! (count-down 0))
  (eprolog-define-predicate (count-down _n)
    (lispp (> _n 0))
    (is _n1 (- _n 1))
    (count-down _n1))

  ;; Test with moderate recursion depth
  (should (eprolog-test--has-solution-p '((count-down 10))))

  ;; Stress test with higher numbers
  (eprolog-define-predicate! (deep-recursion 0 done))
  (eprolog-define-predicate (deep-recursion _n _result)
    (lispp (> _n 0))
    (is _n1 (- _n 1))
    (deep-recursion _n1 _result))

  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((deep-recursion 10 _result)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 1))
    (should (equal (cdr (assoc '_result (car solutions))) 'done))))
  
#+end_SRC

Additional performance tests focus on specific aspects of system behavior:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-large-database ()
  "Test performance with larger clause database."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)
  (dotimes (i 100)
    (eval `(eprolog-define-predicate (test-num ,i))))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((test-num _x)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 100))))
#+end_SRC

Stress testing pushes the system to its limits:

#+begin_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-example-stress-testing ()
  "Test system behavior under stress conditions."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)
  
  ;; Test many predicate clauses
  (dotimes (i 50)
    (eval `(eprolog-define-predicate (many-choices ,i))))
  
  ;; Test that all solutions are found
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((many-choices _x)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 50)))
  
  ;; Test complex recursive predicate
  (eprolog-define-predicate! (deep-recursion 0 done))
  (eprolog-define-predicate (deep-recursion _n _result)
    (lispp (> _n 0))
    (is _n1 (- _n 1))
    (deep-recursion _n1 _result))
  
  (let ((solutions (eprolog-test--collect-solutions '((deep-recursion 10 _result)))))
    (should (= (length solutions) 1))
    (should (equal (cdr (assoc '_result (car solutions))) 'done))))
