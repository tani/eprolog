* Lisp Integration

One of ε-prolog's most remarkable achievements is its seamless fusion with Emacs Lisp, creating a hybrid programming environment where logical and functional paradigms complement each other naturally. This integration isn't just a technical convenience—it's a bridge between two fundamentally different ways of thinking about computation.

The beauty of this integration lies in its bidirectional nature. Prolog queries can invoke Lisp functions to perform calculations, access Emacs features, or manipulate data structures, while Lisp code can query the Prolog knowledge base. This creates a powerful symbiosis where each language contributes its strengths to solve complex problems.

** Basic Lisp Interface

The basic Lisp interface provides predicates that bridge the gap between Prolog's logical world and Lisp's functional world. These predicates are essential for practical programming in ε-prolog.

The basic Lisp interface provides predicates for calling Lisp code from within Prolog queries. This is essential for accessing Emacs functions, performing calculations, and integrating with the Emacs environment.

This subsection covers:
- ~lisp/2~ for evaluating Lisp expressions and capturing results
- ~lispp/1~ for evaluating Lisp expressions as boolean tests
- ~lisp!/1~ for evaluating Lisp expressions for side effects only
- How to pass data between Prolog and Lisp

The following comprehensive test demonstrates all three main ways to interface with Lisp in a single, well-organized test case:

** Lisp Integration Negative Tests

  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)

  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)

  (should-error (eprolog-test--has-solution-p '((lisp! (undef)))))
  (should-not (eprolog-test--has-solution-p '((lisp! (_undef)))))
  )
#+END_SRC

** Lisp Conditional (lispp) Negative Tests

The lispp predicate should fail when expressions return nil or false:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ert-deftest eprolog-feature-lisp-lispp-negative-tests ()
  "Test negative cases for lispp predicate."
  (eprolog-test--restore-builtins)

** Dynamic Parameters

Dynamic parameters provide a way to maintain state across predicate calls within a query. They enable sharing of information between different parts of a Prolog program and facilitate communication between Prolog and Lisp components.

Dynamic parameters provide a sophisticated mechanism for maintaining state and sharing data across different parts of a Prolog computation:
- ~store/2~: Store a value associated with a key
- ~fetch/2~: Retrieve a value by its key
- State persistence during query execution
- Integration with Lisp for complex data manipulation

This mechanism is particularly useful for accumulating results, maintaining counters, or sharing computed values across different predicate invocations.
