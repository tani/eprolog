;;; Commentary:

;; Îµ-prolog (eprolog) is a complete Prolog engine implementation written
;; in pure Emacs Lisp.  It provides a fully functional Prolog system
;; integrated into the Emacs environment, offering traditional Prolog
;; programming capabilities with seamless Lisp interoperability.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Complete unification algorithm with occurs check
;; - Backtracking and choice points with proper cut (!) semantics
;; - Clause database management for facts and rules
;; - Interactive query execution with solution enumeration
;; - Built-in predicates for type checking, control, and list operations
;; - Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) support
;; - Spy/debugging functionality for tracing execution
;; - Direct Lisp integration through special predicates
;;
;; Quick Start:
;;
;;   ;; Define facts and rules
;;   (eprolog-define-prolog-predicate parent (tom bob))
;;   (eprolog-define-prolog-predicate parent (bob ann))
;;
;;   (eprolog-define-prolog-predicate grandparent (_x _z)
;;     (parent _x _y)
;;     (parent _y _z))
;;
;;   ;; Query the database
;;   (eprolog-query (grandparent tom _x))
;;
;; See README.org for detailed documentation.
